# Music Visualiser Project

Name: Immanuel Adeoye

Student Number: C17368666

## Instructions
- Fork this repository and use it a starter project for your assignment
- Create a new package named your student number and put all your code in this package.
- You should start by creating a subclass of ie.tudublin.Visual
- There is an example visualiser called MyVisual in the example package
- Check out the WaveForm and AudioBandsVisual for examples of how to call the Processing functions from other classes that are not subclasses of PApplet

# Description of the assignment
In this assignment I had the task of creating a visual piece that would respond to music. Quoted as " Something beautiful to enjoy while listening to music", So I set out to create something that live up to this quote. So I needed to be able to put together something that is going to showcase what I have learnt from doing this module. To do this project and sucessfully create something beautiful, I would need to apply and use what I've throughout the semester and be creative with it to bring the vision to life. This assignment encourages thinking outside the box and challenges you to use what you've learnt and really utilise to showcase your level of skill and knowledge of it and of course also your creativity. 

What I made:

# Instructions
- Run the program 
- When it opens press the space bar
- Watch the visuals for the duration of the song 
- Enjoy

# How it works
1. You run the program from the Main.java class
2. Wait for the program to open
3. When the program opens, press the space bar to start the music
4. Then watch the visual till the end.

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
What I'm most proud of is actually putting this assignment together. Java isn't really strong point so what I'm most proud is actually being able to have challenged myself and be able to put this together. To be able to challenge myself and be able to make something that really tested my knowledge and ability when it comes to java.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
